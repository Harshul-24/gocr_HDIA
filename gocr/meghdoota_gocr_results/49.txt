Amidst tlie darkness palpable, that shrouds, Deep as the touchstone's gloom, the night with clouds, With glittering lines of yellow lightning break, And frequent trace in heaven the golden streak : To those fond fair who tread the royal way, The path their doubtful feet explore betray, Those thunders hushed, whose shower-foreboding sound Would check their ardour, and their hopes confound. On some cool terrace, where the turtle-dove In gentlest accents breathes connubial love, Repose awhile; or plead your amorous vows Through the long night, the lightning for your spouse.

ANNOTATIONS. Verse 255. Amidst the darkness palpable, that shrouds.) So Milton's celebrated expression,
And through the palpable obscure find out
His uncouth way.--- The literal interpretation of the original passage is, “the darkness that may be pierced with a needle."
