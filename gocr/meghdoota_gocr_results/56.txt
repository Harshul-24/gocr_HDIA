CLOUD MESSENGER.
त्वय्यादातुं जलमवनते शङ्गिणो वर्णचौरे तस्यास्मिन्धोः पृथुमपि तनुं दूरभावात् प्रवाहम् ॥ प्रेक्षिष्यन्ते गगनगतयो नूनमावर्ण्य दृष्टी

Each lute-armed spirit from thy path retires, Lest drops ungenial damp the tuneful wires. Celestial couples, bending from the skies, Turn on thy distant course their downward eyes, And watch thee lessening in thy long descent, To rob the river's scanty stores intent; As clothed in sacred darkness not thine own, Thine is the azure of the costly stone,

ANNOTATIONS. appellation of the Charmanvatí is generally conceived to be the Chumbul, which corresponds with it in source and situation; and which, as it must have been traversed by the Cloud in its northerly course, would most probably have been described by the poet. It may be curious to trace the change of Charmanvatí into Chumbul; which seems very practicable, notwithstanding their present dissimilarity. Tavernier, describing the route from Surat to Agra by way of Brampore, calls this river the Chammelnadi; the possessive termination Vatí (ant) having been confounded with the Nadí (61) 'a river': Chammelnadi is, therefore, the Chammel river. Again, the addition Nadí being regarded as superfluous, it has been dropped altogether, and we have the Chammel, or Chambel. The word Chammel may readily be deduced from Charman; as, in the dialects of Hindustan, the letters N and L are constantly interchangeable, and careless pronunciation may easily convert Charmel into Chammel, or Chambel.
Verse 314. These two lines occur a little earlier in the Sanskrit; but as they seemed more connected with the two following, and to be rather awkward in their original position, they have been introduced here.
Verse 319. In sacred darkness not thine own.] Being of the same dark blue colour as Krishna; a hue the poet charges the Cloud with having stolen.
