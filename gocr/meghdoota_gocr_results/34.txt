CLOUD MESSENGER.
कालक्षेपं ककुभसुरभौ पर्वते पर्वते ते ॥ शुक्लापाङ्गैस्सजलनयनैः स्वागतीकृत्य केकाः प्रत्युद्यातः कथमपि भवान् गन्तुमाशु व्यवस्येत् ॥ २४ ॥
Will not the frequent hill retard thy flight, Nor flowery plain persuade prolonged delight? Or can the Peacock's animated hail, The bird with lucid eyes, to lure thee fail?

ANNOTATIONS. Verse 151. Or can the Peacock's animated hail?] The wild peacock is exceedingly abundant in many parts of Hindustan, and is especially found in marshy places. The habits of this bird are, in a great measure, aquatic; and the setting in of the rains is the season in which they pair. The peacock is therefore always introduced in the description of cloudy or rainy weather, together with the Cranes and Chátakas, whom we have already had occasion to notice. Thus, in a little poem descriptive of the rainy season &c., entitled Ghatakarpara (CoR ), the author says, addressing his mistress
नवासुमताः शिखिनो नदन्नि मेघागमे कुन्दसमानदन्ति ॥ O thou, whose teeth enamelled vie With smiling Kunda's pearly ray, Hear how the Peacock's amorous cry
Salutes the dark and cloudy day! And again, in one of the Satakas or Centos of Bhartri Hari, where he is describing the same season
शिखिकुलकलकेका एव रम्या वनान्ताः सुखिनमसुखिनं वा समुत्कराठयन्ति । When smiling forests, whence the tuneful cries Of clustering pea-fowls shrill and frequent rise; Teach tender feelings to each human breast, And charm alike the happy or distressed.
