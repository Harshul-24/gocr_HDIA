These are my rivals; for the one would greet, As I would willingly, my charmer's feet; And, with my fondness, would the other sip The grateful nectar of her honeyed lip. A golden column, on a crystal base, Begirt with jewels, rises o'er the place.

ANNOTATIONS. Verse 521. These are my rivals, &c.] These allusions refer to some particular notions of the Hindus respecting the Keśara and Asoka, which plants are said to blossom upon being touched respectively by the face or foot of a female: the story is, probably, originally poetical.
Verse 528. The blue-necked Peacock to the summit flies.] The wild Peacock, although it lays its nest upon the ground, is said, by Captain Williamson, to roost constantly on the loftiest trees.
Verse 530. My fair awakens from her tinkling zone.] A girdle of small bells (wg urica) is a favourite Hindu ornament; also silver circles at the ankles and wrists, which emit a ringing noise as the wearer moves.
