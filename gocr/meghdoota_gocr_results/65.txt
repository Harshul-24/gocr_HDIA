Instant afford the aid 'tis thine to lend, And with a thousand friendly streams descend. Of all the fruits that fortune yields, the best Is still the power to succour the distrest.
Shame is the fruit of actions indiscreet, And vain presumption ends but in defeat.

ANNOTATIONS. Which, omitting a few repetitions and excrescences, may be thus translated :
The forest flames—the foliage, sear and dry, Bursts in a blaze beneath the torrid sky. Fanned by the gale, the fires resplendent grow, Brighter than blooming Safflower's vermil glow; Brighter than Minium's fierceness, as they wind Around the branch, or shoot athwart the rind : Play through the leaves, along the trunk ascend, And o'er the top in tapering radiance end. The crackling Bambu rushing flames surround, Roar through the rocks, and through the caves resound. The dry blade fuel to their rage supplies, And instant flame along the herbage flies, Involves the forest tenants in its sphere, And in its rapid course outstrips the deer. Like palest gold the towering ray aspires, And wafting gusts diffuse the wasting fires : Wide fly the sparks, the burning branches fall, And one relentless blaze envelopes all.
