Those glancing eyes, those lightning looks unseen, Dark are thy days, and thou in vain hast been. Diverging thither now the road proceeds, Where eddying waters fair Nirvindhya leads, Who speaks the language amorous maids devise, The lore of signs, the eloquence of eyes ;

ANNOTATIONS. Verse 184. Dark are thy days.] The expression of the poet is simply, “If you do not enjoy “the glances, &c., you are defrauded” (afsn sf), and the Commentators explain it by adding, " of the object of your life." That is, if you have not seen these beauties, you might as well have been blind, or not have existed at all. This compliment is rather hyperbolical; but we are acquainted with it in Europe: and the Italian proverb, “He who has not seen Rome has not seen any thing," conveys a similar idea.
Verse 186. Fair Nirvindhya leads.] This stream has not been found by name in the maps; but a number of small rivers occur between the Parbatty and the river mentioned below, the Sipra, one of which must be the Nirvindhya of the poet. The four following lines, descriptive of the female personification of the current, are englished rather with respect to the sense than the words, the plainness of which might perhaps offend European fastidiousness. There is not, however, any one of Kálidása's river-ladies who behaves so indecorously as several of Drayton's similar personifications; and there is not one of them possessed of speech at all, to say nothing of such speech as is made use of by the Hayle, and other like " lusty nymphs," of that author's Poly-olbion.
