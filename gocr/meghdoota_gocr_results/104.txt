ANNOTATIONS. yet investigated, are usually called acist and Alist, or "River-born,' and 'Tapti-born,' in reference to their being found in the course of the Tapti river.
Verse 707. Why should the god who wields the five-fold dart.] Kámadeva, the Hindu Cupid, is represented as the Eros of the Greeks, armed with a bow and arrows. These weapons are of peculiar construction, and most poetically formed. The bow is of sugar-cane ; the bow-string consists of a line of bees; and the arrows are tipped each with a separate flower. The weapons and application of the allegory will be best explained by a verse in Sir William Jones's Hymn to this deity:
He bends the luscious cane, and twists the string, With bees how sweet, but, ah! how keen their sting! He with five flowrets tips the ruthless darts, Which through five senses pierce enraptured hearts. Strong Chumpa, rich in odorous gold; Warm Arka, nursed in heavenly mould; Dry Nagesar, in silver smiling; Hot Kriticum, our sense beguiling ; And last, to kindle fierce the scorching flame,
Love shaft, which gods bright Bela name. In the Romaunt of the Rose there is something of a similar allegory: Cupid is armed with "ten brode arrows;" of which, “five were shaven well and dight," and of a nature to produce virtuous attachment; while the other five, “also black as fiend in hell,” were Pride,' Villaine,' &c., and of pernicious properties.
