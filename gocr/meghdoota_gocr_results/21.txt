Her task to weep our destiny severe, And count the moments of the lingering year: A painful life she leads, but still she lives, While hope its aid invigorating gives; For female hearts, though fragile as the flower, Are firm, when closed by hope's investing power.

Still, as thou mountest on thine airy flight, Shall widowed wives behold thee with delight, With eager gaze, their long locks drawn apart, Whilst hope re-animates each drooping heart: Nor less shall husbands, as thy course they trace, Expect at hand a faithful wife's embrace ; Unless, like me, in servitude they bend, And on another's lordly will depend.
