ब्रह्मावर्त जनपदमधश्छायया गाहमानः क्षेत्र क्षत्रप्रधनपिशुनं कौरवं तद् भजेथाः ॥ राजन्यानां शितशरशतैर्यत्र गाण्डीवधन्वा

Hence to the land of Brahma’s favoured sons, O'er Kuru's fatal field, thy journey runs. With deepest glooms hang o'er the deadly plain, Dewed with the blood of mighty warriors slain. There Arjun's wrath opposing armies felt, And countless arrows strong Gándíva dealt,

ANNOTATIONS they afford a very delicate and truly poetical resemblance to the dark iris, and white ball of a full black eye.
Verse 331. Hence to the land of Brahma's favoured sons.] Brahmávartta (aaraa) is the abode of Brahmá, or the holy land of the Hindus. It is thus described by Menu, ii. 17:
सरखतीदृषद्वत्योर्देवनद्योर्यदन्तरम् ।
तं देवनिर्मितं देशं ब्रह्मावर्त प्रचक्षते ॥ " Between the two divine rivers, Saraswati and Drishadwatí, lies the tract of land which the sages have named Brahmávartta, because it was frequented by the gods."
Verse 332. Kuru-Kshetra (976 ), the Field of the Kurus, is the scene of the celebrated battle between them and the Pándus, which forms the subject of the Mahabharata. It lies a little to the south-east of Tahnesar, and is still a place of note and pilgrimage. It is not far from Panniput, the seat of another celebrated engagement, that between the assembled Princes of Hindustan, and the combined strength of the Marhattas. This part of the country, indeed, presenting few obstacles to the movement of large armies, has in every period of the history of Hindustan been the theatre of contention.
Verse 335. Arjun was the friend and pupil of Krishna, and the third of the Pandava Princes. He has been long ago introduced to European readers, especially in Sir Charles Wilkins's able translation of the Bhagavad-Gitá; and appears, in the opening of that poem, in a very amiable light:
अहोवत महत पापं कई व्यवसिता वयम् । यद्राज्यसुखलोभेन हनुं खजनमुद्यताः ॥४४॥
