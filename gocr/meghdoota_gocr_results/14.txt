तस्मिन्नद्रौ कतिचिदबलाविप्रयुक्तः स कामी नीत्वा मासान कनकवलय_शरिक्तप्रकोष्ठः ॥ आषाढस्य प्रथमदिवसे मेघमाश्लिष्टसानुं वप्रक्रीडापरिणतगजप्रेक्षणीयं ददर्श ॥२॥
To these drear hills through circling days confined, In dull unvaried grief, the god repined; And sorrow, withering every youthful charm,, Had slipped the golden bracelet from his arm; When with Ashárha's glooms the air was hung, And one dark Cloud around the mountain clung ; In form, some elephant, whose sportive rage, Ramparts, scarce equal to his might, engage.

ANNOTATIONS. Verse 10. Had slipped the golden bracelet from his arm.] This is a favourite idea with Hindu poets, and repeatedly occurs : thus, in the elegant drama of Sakuntala, Dushmanta says:
इदमशिशिरैरजस्तापाद्विवर्णमणीकृतं निशि निशि भुजन्यस्तापाङ्गप्रसारिभिरश्रुभिः । अनभिलुलितज्याघाताकान्मुहुर्मणिबन्धनात्
कनकवलयं सस्तं सस्तं मया प्रतिसाय्यते ॥ or, in Sir William Jones's version, "This golden bracelet, sullied by the flame which preys on me, and which no dew mitigates, but the tears gushing nightly from my eyes, has fallen again and again on my wrist, and has been replaced on my emaciated arm.”
Verse 11. When with Ashárha's glooms.] The month Áshád’ha or Ashár'ha comprehends the latter part of June and the commencement of July, and is the period about which the south-west monsoon, or rainy season, usually sets in. ___Verse 13. In form, some elephant.] Thus, in the Purana Sarvaswa, clouds are described as HEUTA TUETA Arasofpur: Shaped like buffaloes, boars, and wild elephants.' In Chapman's Bussy D'Ambois, they are said to assume,
In our faulty apprehensions, The forms of dragons, lions, elephants. B2
