With sacred glooms the darkening waves shall glide, As where the Jumna mixes with the tide. As Siva's Bull upon his sacred neck, Amidst his ermine, owns some sable speck ; So shall thy shade upon the mountain show, Whose sides are silvered with eternal snow; Where Gungá leads her purifying waves, And the Musk Deer spring frequent from the caves.

ANNOTATIONS. Verse 358. As where the Jumna mingles with the tide.] The waters of the Jumna, or Yamuna, are described as much darker than those of the Ganges at the point of their confluence, from the circumstances of the stream being less shallow and less discoloured with clay or sand. Occasionally, indeed, the waters of the Ganges there are so white from the diffusion of earthy particles, that, according to the creed of the natives, the river flows with milk. The confluence of rivers always forms a sacred spot in India: but tlie meeting of the Ganges and Jumna at Prayaga or Allahabad, from the sanctity of both the currents, and from the supposed subterraneous additiou of the Saraswatí, is a place of distinguished holiness.
Verse 359. As Siva's Bull upon his sacred neck.] The Bull is the vehicle of Siva, and the animal of the god is always painted of a milk-white colour.
Verse 364. And the Musk Deer spring frequent from the caves.] This animal is what is called the Thibet Musk; “ but its favourite residence is among the lofty Himalley (Himalaya) mountains, which divide Tartary from Hindustán." See the best account of the Musk Deer yet published, in Gladwin's Oriental Miscellany, Calcutta 1798, accompanied with accurate drawings by Mr. Home, of the figure, tceth, hoofs, &c.
