PREFACE.
acquiesced in the republication, in the hope that it will afford no greater help than it is designed to render; for experience has satisfied me that the aid of Translations, in the study of any language, except for a short time, perhaps, in the earliest stage of it, is exceedingly mischievous and deceptive. It induces carelessness, encourages indolence, exercises no faculty but the memory, and employs that faculty with so little energy of application, that the impressions received are faint and superficial, and fade and are effaced almost as soon as they are made. The progress effected with such assistance is a mere waste of even the scant expenditure of time and trouble with which it has been attained; for it is unreal — a mere mockeryas the learner will soon discover, to his surprise, and, if he feel rightly, to his mortification, when he tries his strength upon passages unprovided with such illusory aid, and finds that he is as little able to understand them as if his studies were yet to be begun. It has been with some reluctance, therefore, that I have assented to the proposition; and have done so only in the trust that the verse translation will by no means obviate the necessity of independent exertion.
The Translation of the Megha Dúta was the first attempt made by me to interest European readers in the results of my Sanskrit studies. It has the imperfections of a juvenile work; and the Translator has no doubt sometimes not only departed from his original further than was necessary, but further than was justifiable; and has occasionally mistaken its meaning.
