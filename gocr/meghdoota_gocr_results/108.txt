ANNOTATIONS. Verse 740. The serpent couch is the great snake Ananta, upon which Vishnu, or, as he is here called, the Holder of the bow Sárnga (the horn-bow), reclines, during four months, from the llth of Asharha to the llth of Kartik; or, as it has occurred in 1813 (the year in which the first edition was printed), from the 23d of June to the 26th of October. The sleep of Vishău, during the four months of the periodical rains in Hindustan, seems to bear an emblematical relation to that season. It has been compared to the Egyptian Hieroglyphical account of the sleep of Horus, typical of the annual overflow of the Nile, by the late Mr. Paterson, in his ingenious Essay on the Origin of the Hindu Religion. Asiatic Researches, vol. viii.
