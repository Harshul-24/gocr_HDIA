And vain thy struggles to escape her wiles, Or disappoint those sweetly treacherous smiles, Which glistening Sapharas insidious dart, Bright as the lotus, at thy vanquished heart.
ANNOTATIONS. Verse 281.

Assigning the attributes of female beauty to a stream, ceases to be incongruous when we advert to its constant personification by the Hindus: and it is as philosophical as it is poetical, to affiance a River and a Cloud. The smiles of rivers, nay, of the Ocean itself, have often been distributed by poetical imagination : thus Lucretius, invoking Venus, says,
Tibi rident æquora ponti.
The ocean waves laugh on you: for his late translator, Mr. Good, is very angry at the conversion of this laugh into a smile, as effected by less daring of his predecessors. Milton again gives to the Ocean, nose, as well as dimples:
Cheered with the grateful smell, old Ocean smiles, And Metastasio, in his beautiful Ode to Venus, has,
E i flutti ridono
Nel mar placati. The waves now placid play,
And laugh amidst the deep. All these, however, as well as our author, are far surpassed by Drayton, in his Poly-olbion ; where hill and dale, forest and river, are constantly described with male or female attributes. With respect to the streams, he is not satisfied with wedding them to various objects, but fairly subjects them to the pains of parturition. The instances are frequent; but we may be content with the following, especially as it is explained and defended by his very learned illustrator:
