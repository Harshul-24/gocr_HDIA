There, when the Sun restores the rising day, What deeds of love his tell-tale beams display! The withered garlands on the pathway found; The faded lotus prostrate on the ground; The pearls, that bursting zones have taught to roam, Speak of fond maids, and wanderers from home. Here filled with modest fears, the Yaksha's bride Her charms from passion's eagerness would hide ;

ANNOTATIONS. Verse 470. Speak of fond maids, and wanderers from home.] I have already mentioned that the Hindus always send the lady to seek her lover, and they usually add a very reasonable degree of ardour and impatience. Our poet, in another place, compares the female so engaged to a rapid current. Thus, in the Ritu Sanhāra:
निपातयन्यः परितस्तटदुमान् प्रवृद्धवेगैस्सलिलैरनिर्मलैः । स्त्रियः प्रकामा इव जातविभ्रमाः
प्रयान्ति नद्यस्त्वरितं पयोनिधिम् ॥ Fast flow the turbid torrents, as they sweep The shelving valleys to rejoin the decp : Impetuous as the maid whom passion warms, And drives impatient to her lover's arms, Along they bound with unresisted force, And banks and trees demolish in their course.
