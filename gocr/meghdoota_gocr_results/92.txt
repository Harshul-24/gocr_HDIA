In vain the lute for harmony is strung, And round the robe-neglected shoulder slung ; And faltering accents strive to catch in vain Our race's old commemorative strain : The falling tear, that from reflection springs, Corrodes incessantly the silvery strings; Recurring woe still pressing on the heart, The skilful hand forgets its grateful art,

ANNOTATIONS. Verse 573. In vain the lute for harmony is strung.] The late is here put for the Víná or Been, a stringed instrument of sacred origin, and high celebrity amongst the Hindus. In Bengal, however, players on this instrument are very rarely met with ; and amongst the natives of this province, the English fiddle is its substitute. In the Játras, or dramatic performances still current amongst them, I have seen the entrance of Nárada, the traditionary inventor of the Víná, bearing, in its stead, a violin. The Víná is much the most harmonious and scientific of all the Hindu instruments of music. A description of it may be found in the First Volume of the Asiatic Researches.
Verse 574. “Robe-neglected” is here put for Afghaha, dirty clothes. So Laodameia says:
Et quâ possum squalore tuos imitare labores, &c.
And with my squalid vesture ape thy toils. Verse 576. Our race's old commemorative strain.] “The verse made in honour of my kindred”: a circumstance that points out some affinity to the songs of the ancient minstrels and family bards.
