Where on rich boughs the clustering flower depends, And low to earth the tall Mandára bends ; Pride of the grove, whose wants my fair supplies, And nurtures like a child---my dwelling lies.

There is the fountain, emerald steps denote, Where golden buds on stalks of coral float; And for whose limpid waves the Swans forsake, Pleased at thy sight, the mount-encircled lake.
ANNOTATIONS. Verse 504. The tall Mandára.] The Coral-tree, Erythrina Indica.
Verse 506. And nurtures like a child.] Tender attachment to natural objects is one of the most pleasing features in the poetical compositions of the Hindus. It is very frequently expressed, and perhaps in few places with more beauty than in the drama of Sakuntala, where, upon departing from the bower of her foster-father, she bids adieu to the plants she had carefully tended, and the orphan fawn she had reared. The whole of this scene must be read with pleasure, and may be classed with the departure of Goldsmith's village family from Auburn, and the farewell of Eve to the bowers of Paradise.
