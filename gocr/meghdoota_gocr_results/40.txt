And seeks, with lavish beauty, to arrest Thy course, and woo thee to her bridal breast.

The torrent passed, behold the Sindhu glide, As though the hair-band bound the slender tide ; Bleached with the withered foliage, that the breeze Has showered rude from overhanging trees : To thee she looks for succour, to restore Her lagging waters, and her leafy shore. Behold the city whose immortal fame Glows in Avanti's or Visala's name!

ANNOTATIONS. Verse 191. Behold the Sindhu glide.] This is a stream also, with which the maps are not acquainted by name. As, however, it is the nearest river to Oujein, it may probably be the same with that now called Ságurmuttee. The river having been diminished by the preceding hot weather, the poet compares it to a long single braid of hair; and, conformably to the personification of it as a female, he supposes the braid to have been bound, in consequence of the absence of the Cloud, after the fashion in which the hair is worn by those women whose husbands are absent;-a custom we shall again be called upon to notice.
Verse 196. The synonyms of Oujein are thus enumerated in the Vocabulary of Hemachandra:
उज्जयिनी स्याद्विशाला वन्नी पुष्पकरण्डिनी। Ujjayini, Visala, Avanti, and Pushpakarandini.
