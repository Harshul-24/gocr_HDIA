When, as her Siva's twilight rites begin, And he would clothe him in the reeking skin, He deems thy form the sanguinary hide, And casts his elephant attire aside; For at his shoulders, like a dusky robe, Mantling, impends thy vast and shadowy globe; Where ample forests, stretched its skirts below, Projecting trees like dangling limbs bestow; And vermil roses, fiercely blooming, shed Their rich reflected glow, their blood-resembling red.

ANNOTATIONS. The action, the elephant skin, and other attributes of Siva, are well described in a passage cited by Mr. Colebrooke, in his Essay on Sanskrit Prosody, from the Drama of Bhavabhúti, though there assigned to a form of his consort Durga :
प्रचलितकरिकृत्तिययन्तचंचनखायातभिनेन्दुनिस्पन्दमानामृतश्योतजीवकपालावलीमुक्तवण्डाढहासत्रसद्भरिभूतप्रवृत्तस्तुतिः The elephant hide that robes thee, to thy steps Swings to and fro; the whirling talons rend The crescent on thy brow; from the torn orb The trickling nectar falls; and every scull That gems thy necklace laughs with horrid life. Attendant spirits tremble and applaud.
