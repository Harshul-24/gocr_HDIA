Lightened by tasks like these, the day proceeds ; But much I dread a bitterer night succeeds, When thou shalt view her on the earth's cold breast, Or lonely couch of separation rest, Disturbed by tears those pallid cheeks that burn, And visions of her dearer half's return. Now seeking sleep, a husband to restore; And waking now, his absence to deplore; Deprived of slumber by returning woes, Or mocked by idle phantoms of repose ; Till her slight form, consumed by ceaseless pain, Shews like the moon, fast hastening to its wane. Crisp from the purifying wave, her hair Conceals the charms, no more her pleasing care ;
