MEGHA DÚTA, OR
कस्यात्यन्तं सुखमुपगतं दुःखमेकान्ततो वा नीचैर्गच्छत्युपरि च दशा चक्रनेमिक्रमेण ॥ १०९ ॥
736
“ Trust to futurity; for still we view “ The always wretched, always blest, are few : " Life like a wheel's revolving orb, turns round, “ Now whirled in air, now dragged along the ground.
ANNOTATIONS. Reference to the principle is very frequent in the writings of the Hindus. The Atmana Bodha, or "Knowledge of Spirit,' a small treatise which contains the ethical part of the Vedanta philosophy, and which has been translated and published by Dr. Taylor, concludes with this stanza:
दिग्देशकालाद्यनपेक्ष्य सगं शीतादिहृनित्यसुखं निरञ्जनम् । यः खात्मतीर्थ व्रजते विनिष्क्रियः
सः सबैवित् सर्व्वगतो अमृतो भवेत् “He who has made the pilgrimage of his own spirit, a pilgrimage in which there is no concern respecting situation, place, or time; which is everywhere; in which neither cold nor heat are experienced ; which bestows perpetual happiness and freedom from sorrow; he is without action, knows all things, pervades all things, and obtains eternal beatitude."
A fine passage inculcating the same feeling occurs in Menu ; ch. viii. 84, where the legislator exhorts a witness to speak the truth :
आत्मैव ह्यात्मनः साक्षी गतिरात्मा तथात्मनः।
मा -वमंस्थाः खमात्मानं नणां साक्षिणमुत्तमम् ॥ " The soul itself is its own witness ; the soul itself is its own refuge : offend not thy conscious soul, the supreme internal witness of men." Sir William Jones's Translation. Verse 737.] Plutarch, in his 'Consolation to Apollonius,' has a similar idea, in similar words:
Tpoxov [rap] TeptoTeixopros, anmol' rj repa Αψις ύπερθε γίγνετ', άλλοθ' ή τέρα. The wheel of Life is ever on the round, While one side's up, the other's on the ground.
