Condemned amidst these dreary rocks to pine, And all I wish, and all I love, resign. Where dwell the Yakshas in their sparkling fields, And Siva's crescent groves surrounding gilds, Direct thy licensed journey, and relate To her who mourns in Alaká, my fate. There shalt thou find the partner of my woes, True to her faith, and stranger to repose ;

ANNOTATIONS. Verse 50. Where Siva's crescent realms surrounding yilds.] The crest of Siva is the new moon, which is sometimes described as forming a third eye in his forehead. The Himalaya mountains, amongst which we shall hereafter find Kailasa to be situated, are Siva's favourite haunts. He also resides occasionally on that mountain, and is represented as the particular friend and frequent guest of Kuvera.
Verse 52. I have here taken a liberty with the order of the original, and brought the description of the Yaksha's wife a little in advance, in order to preserve the description which follows, of the Cloud's progress, more connected. The Hindu poets are not very solicitous in general about arrangement; but it is possible that in this case I may not have improved upon that of Kalidas. The 10th stanza of the Sanskrit corresponds with these lines..
Verse 53. Alaká is the capital of Kuvera, and the residence of his dependent deities.
