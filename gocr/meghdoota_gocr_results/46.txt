मामन्द्राणां फलमविकलं लप्स्यसे गर्जितानाम् ॥ ३६॥ पादन्यासक्वणितरसनास्तत्र लीलावधूतैरत्नच्छायाखचितबलिभिश्चामरैः क्लान्तहस्ताः ॥
In Mahadeva's fane the measure tread, Or wave the gorgeous chowrie o'er his head, Shall turn on thee the grateful-speaking eye, Whose glances gleam, like bees, along the sky, As from thy presence, showers benign and sweet . Cool the parched earth, and soothe their tender feet.

- ANNOTATIONS. Verse 238. The gorgeous chowrie.] The Chowrie, or more properly Chounri (s ), is a brush of Peacock's feathers, or the tail of a particular kind of cow, &c., set in a handle of such materials as suit the fancy or the means of the proprietor. It is used for a fan, or to whisk off flies and other insects; and this piece of attention is always paid by the Hindus to the figures of their gods.
Verse 240. Whose glances gleam, like bees, along the sky.] Although this allusion may be new to European imagery, it is just and pleasing. The consequence of the glance is well conveyed by the sting of the bee, while its poetically radiating nature is not unaptly compared to the long flight of a line of these insects. The lengthened light of a glance is familiar to us; for Shakspeare speaks of“ eyes streaming through the airy region”: and the continuous flight of bees was noticed so long back as the time of Homer, who describes them as proceeding in branches, a circumstance which his translator, Pope, has omitted :
Βοτρυδόν δε πέτονται επ' άνθεσιν ειαρινοίσιν.
Branching, they fly abroad o'er vernal flowers; Or, as in Pope,
Clust'ring, in heaps on heaps, the driving bees &c. Verse 242. And soothe their tender feet.] It is to be recollected that these ladies are dancing bare-footed: divesting the feet of the shoes is a mark of reverence or respect paid to sacred places, such as the interior or vestibule of a temple, which has been from the remotest times practised in the East, as we know from the authority of Scripture.
