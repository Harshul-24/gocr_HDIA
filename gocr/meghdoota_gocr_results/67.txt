Devoutly pass, and with religious glow Around the spot in pious circles go: For there have Saints the sacred altar raised, And there eternal offerings have blazed, And blest tlie faithful worshippers ; for they The stain of sin with life shall cast away, And, after death, a glad admittance gain To Siva's glorious and immortal train.

ANNOTATIONS. Verse 380. Around the spot in pious circles go.] Circumambulating a venerable object, or person, is a usual mark of profound respect. Thus, in Sakuntala, Kanwa thus addresses his foster-daughter, on the eve of her departure :
वत्से इतः सद्यो हताग्नीन प्रदक्षिणीकुरुष्व । “My best beloved, come and walk with me round the sacrificial fire." And again, in the Rámáyana, we have the same ceremony described thus :
जनकस्य वचः श्रुत्वा पाणीन् पाणिभिरस्पृशन् । चत्वारस्ते चतसृणां वशिष्ठस्य मते स्थिताः ॥ अग्निं प्रदक्षिणं कृत्वा वेदि राजानमेव च ।
ऋषीश्चापि महात्मानः सहभायो रघूद्वहाः ॥ "Hearing the words of Janaka, the four supporters of Raghu's race, previously placed accord“ing to the direction of Vašishtha, took the hands of the four damsels within theirs, and, with " their spouses, circumambulated the fire, the altar, the king, and the sages."
Rámáyana, with Translation, 1, 60, 37. A somewhat similar practice seems to have been in use amongst the Celtic nations. The Highland leech, who is called to the aid of Waverley, “would not proceed to any operation until he had perambulated his couch three times, moving from east to west, according to the course of the sun." And Sir Walter Scott observes, in a Note, that “the Highlanders will still make the deasil' ” (the circumambulation, or pra-dakshiña)" around those whom they wish well to."
