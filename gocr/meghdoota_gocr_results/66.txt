The Mussulmans also have the same notion with respect to many of the Prophets; for they believe that the marks of Adam's feet remain on a mountain in the centre of Ceylon; and that those of Abraham were impressed upon a stone which was formerly at Mecca, and which he had used as a temporary scaffold in constructing the upper part of the primary Kaaba. A number of similar stories may be found in Mirkhond, and other Mohammedan authors. The Himalaya mountains are the scene of most of Siva's adventures, his religious abstraction, his love, marriage, &c.; and the place here mentioned may have some connexion with the Ghát, and neighbouring hill at Haridwara, mentioned in Capt.
