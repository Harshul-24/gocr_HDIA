' For still this fear especially must wait — On every creature of our passing state.
What though to distance driven by wrath divine, * Imagination joins his form with thine. — Such as I view, is his emaciate frame ; — Such his regrets ; his scorching pangs the same ; • To every sigh of thine his sigh replies, ' And tears responsive trickle from his eyes. ' By thee unheard, by those bright eyes unseen, ' Since fate resists, and regions intervene,
To me the message of his love consigned Pourtrays the sufferings of his constant mind.

ANNOTATIONS. Verse 675. For still this fear especially must wait.] It is to be recollected here, that even these heavenly Beings are of a perishable nature, and subject to the infirmities of existence. The whole are swept away at each Mahá-pralaya, or destruction of the Universe,
Which, like the baseless fabric of a vision, Leaves not a wreck behind.
