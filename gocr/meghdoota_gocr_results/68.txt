Here wake the chorus:—bid the thunder's sound, Deep and reiterated, roll around, Loud as a hundred drums ;-while softer strains The swelling gale breathes sweetly through the canes ; And from the lovely songsters of the skies, Hymns to the victor of Tripura rise. Thence to the snow-clad hills thy course direct, And Krauncha's celebrated pass select;

ANNOTATIONS. Verse 391. The lovely songsters of the skies) are the females of the Kinnaras, or demigods, attendant upon Kuvera, and the musicians of Swarga.
Verse 392. Hymns to the victor of Tripura rise.] Tripura is the name of a city, or rather, as its etymology implies, three cities collectively: these formed the domain of a celebrated Demon, or Asur, destroyed by Śiva, and were reduced to ashes by that Deity. According to the Commentators, we have here a full and complete concert in honour of Mahadeva.
Verse 394. And Krauncha's celebrated pass select.] I have not been able to make any thing of this pass or hole (EG). The original text states it to be on the very skirt (349) of the snowy mountain, and calls it also HER, .The gate of the geese,' who fly annually this way to the Mánasarovara lake. Krauncha is described as a mountain, in the Mahabharat ; and, being personified, is there called the son of Maináka. A mountain also called Krauncha Meru occurs in Mr. Wilford's lists, amongst those mountains situated in the north. It must lie at some distance from the plains; and perhaps the Poet, by using the term 349, implies its relative situation with the loftiest part of the range or proper snow-clad mountains.
