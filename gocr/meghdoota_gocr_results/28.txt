त्वामासारप्रशमितवनोपप्लवं साधु मूभी वक्ष्यत्यध्वश्रमपरिगतं सानुमानाम्रकूटः ॥ न क्षुद्रो पि प्रथमसुकतापेक्षया संश्रयाय प्राप्ने मित्रे भवति विमुखः किम्पुनर्यस्तथोच्चैः ॥ १७ ॥
Oft have thy showers the mountain's flames allayed, Then fear not wearied to demand its aid. Not e'en the basest, when a falling friend Solicits help it once was his to lend, The aid that gratitude exacts denies : Much less shall noble minds the claim despise.

ANNOTATIONS. this conjecture be correct, it will invalidate the derivation assigned with some ingenuity to the word Omerkuntuk, in a prefatory note to a pleasing little oriental poem published in England, called the Metamorphosis of Sona. The author of that note imagines the proper name to be Omer Khandaka; and he is happy in the affinity of the sound, though not in his definition of the sense, as “the district of Omer” is exceedingly unmeaning, and erroneous. Amara Khandaka might mean the “immortal portion,” but I do not know of any reason for assigning such an epithet to the mountain in question.
Verse 107. The Hindus have been the object of much idle panegyric, and equally idle detraction. Some writers have invested them with every amiable attribute, and they have been deprived by others of the common virtues of humanity. Amongst the excellencies denied to them, gratitude has been always particularized; and there are many of the European residents in India who scarcely imagine that the natives of the country ever heard of such a sentiment. To them, and to all detractors on this head, the above verse is a satisfactory reply; and that no doubt of its tenor may remain, I add the literal translation of the original passage. “Even a low man, when his friend comes to him for assistance, will not turn away his face, in consideration of former kindness ;-how, therefore, should the exalted act thus?”
