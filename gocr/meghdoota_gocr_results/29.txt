When o'er the wooded mountain's towering head Thy hovering shades like flowing tresses spread, Its form shall shine with charms unknown before, That heavenly hosts may gaze at, and adore ; This earth's round breast, bright swelling from the ground, And with thy orb as with a nipple crowned. Next bending downwards from thy lofty flight, On Chitrakuta's humbler peak alight; O'er the tall hill thy weariness forego, And quenching rain-drops on its flames bestow; For speedy fruits are certain to await Assistance yielded to the good and great.
