What breast so firm unmoved by female charms ? Not thine, my friend : for now her waving arms, O’erhanging Bayas, in thy grasp enclosed, Rent her coerulean vest, and charms exposed, Prove how successfully she tempts delay, And wins thee loitering from the lengthening way. Thence, satiate, lead along the gentle breeze That bows the lofty summits of the trees;

ANNOTATIONS. When Pool, quoth she, was young, a lusty sea-born lass, Great Albion to this nymph an earnest suitor was, And bare himself so well, and so in favour came, That he in little time upon this lovely dame
Begot three maiden Isles, his darlings and delight. “As Albion (son of Neptune), from whom that first name of this Britain was supposed, is well fitted to the fruitful bed of this Pool, thus personated as a sea-nymph, the plain truth (as words may certify your eyes, saving all impropriety of object) is, that in the Pool are seated three isles, Bruntsey, Fursey, and St. Helen's, in situation and magnitude as I name them. Nor is the fiction of begetting the Isles improper, seeing Greek antiquities tell us of divers in the Mediterranean and the Archipelagus; as, Rhodes, Delus, Hiera, the Echinades, and others which have been, as it were, brought forth out of the salt womb of Amphitrite.” SELDEN'S Illustrations.
