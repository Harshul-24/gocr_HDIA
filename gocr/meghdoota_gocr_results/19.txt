MEGHA DÚTA, OR
याचा मोघा वरमधिगुणे नाधमे लब्धकामा ॥६॥ सन्तप्तानां त्वमसि शरणं तत् पयोद प्रियायास्सन्देशं मे हर धनपतिक्रोधविश्लेषितस्य ॥
For, better far, solicitation fail With high desert, than with the base prevail. Thou art the wretch's aid, affliction's friend ; To me, unfortunate, thy succour lend : My lonely state compassionate behold, Who mourn the vengeance of the god of gold ;

ANNOTATIONS. “on that account, they are called in this world, Pushkarávarttakas.” So also it is said, upon the authority of the Váyu, Linga, and Matsya Puráňas, “The third class of clouds is that of “the Pakshaja, or those which were originally the wings of the mountains that were cut off " by Indra.

CUMBERLAND's Translation. Verse 40. For, better far, solicitation fail &c.] This is a sentiment of rather an original strain, and indicates considerable elevation of mind. Something of the same kind occurs in Massinger's play of the “Bondman;" where Pisander says,
I'd rather fall under so just a judge, Than be acquitted by a judge corrupt
And partial in his censure. Verse 46. The god of gold,] Kúvera. See above.
