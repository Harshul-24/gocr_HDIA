नुद्यानानां नवजलकणैयूँथिकाजालकानि ॥ गण्डस्वेदापनयनरुजा क्लान्तकर्णोत्पलानां छायादानात् क्षणपरिचितः पुष्पलावीमुखानाम् ॥ २६ ॥ वक्रः पन्था यदपि भवतः प्रस्थितस्योत्तराशां सौधोत्सङ्गप्रणयविमुखो मा च भूरुज्जयिन्याः ॥

Grant for a while thy interposing shroud, To where those damsels woo the friendly Cloud; As, while the garland's flowery stores they seek, The scorching sunbeams singe the tender cheek, The ear-hung lotus fades: and vain they chase, Fatigued and faint, the drops that dew the face. What though to northern climes thy journey lay, Consent to track a shortly devious way; To fair Ujjayinís palaces and pride, And beauteous daughters, turn awhile aside.

ANNOTATIONS. Verse 175. As, while the garland's flowery stores they seek.] The use of garlands in the decoration of the houses and temples of the Hindus, and of flowers in their offerings and festivals, furnishes employment to a particular tribe or caste, the Málakáras or wreath-makers. The females of this class are here alluded to.
Verse 181. Ujjayiní, or the modern Oujein, is supposed to have been the residence of our poet, and the capital of his celebrated patron, Vikramaditya. Few cities, perhaps, can boast of a more continuous reputation; as it has been a place of great note, from the earliest periods of Hindu tradition down to the present day. It is now in the possession of the family of Scindiah, and is the capital of his territories. A full and highly-interesting account of it is to be found in the Sixth Volume of the Asiatic Researches, in the Narrative of a Journey from Agra to this city, by the late Dr. Hunter,-a gentleman, the activity of whose mind was only equalled by the accuracy of his judgment, and the extensiveness of whose acquirements was only paralleled by the unwearied continuance of his exertions.
