And murmuring softly, gentle sounds prepare, With words like these to raise her from despair:

' Oh, wife adored! whose lord still lives for thee; — Behold his friend and messenger in me ;
Who now approach thy beauteous presence, fraught 'With many a tender and consoling thought! Such tasks are mine :—where absent lovers stray,
I speed the wanderer lightly on his way; ' And, with my thunders, teach his lagging mind
New hopes the braid of absence to unbind.' As beauteous Maithilí with glad surprise Bent on the Son of air her opening eyes, So my fair partner's pleased uplifted gaze Thy friendly presence with delight surveys.
