ANNOTATIONS. Verse 243. Bhaváni shall herself approve.] Bhavani is one of the many names of the consort of Siva. The reason of her satisfaction, and indeed the whole of this passage, although familiar to a Hindu, and although much amplified in the translation, requires a little explanation, to be rendered intelligible to the English reader. Siva is supposed to be dancing at the performance of the evening Sandhya, and to have assumed as his cloak the bloody skin of an elephant formerly belonging to an Asura destroyed by him. As this is no very seemly ornament, Bhaváni is delighted to find it supplied by the Cloud; which being of a dusky red, through the reflexion of the China roses now abundant, and being skirted, as it overhangs a forest, by the projecting branches of trees, resembles the elephant hide in colour, and its dangling limbs as well as in its bulk, and is mistaken for it by Siva in his religious enthusiasm. The office performed by the Cloud has often been assigned to it in the West : thus, Horace, Ode II. Book I.:
Nube candentes humeros amictus,
Augur Apollo. Or come Apollo, versed in fate, and shroud
Thy shining shoulders with a veiling cloud. So Milton, in his Penseroso, speaking of the Morning, describes it as
Kerchief'd in a comely cloud. Lee invests sentiments of the mind with a similar garb, and has
For true Repentance never comes to late; As soon as born, she makes herself a shroud,
The weeping mantle of a fleecy cloud. And a Poet of later day, but of no inferior name, has made a very fine use of this figure:
I've known her long, of worth most excellent ; But in the day of woe she ever rose Upon the mind with added majesty; As the dark mountain more sublimely towers, Mantled in clouds and storm.
