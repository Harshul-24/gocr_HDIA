Now, o'er the cheek the Lodh's pale pollen shines, Now midst their curls the Amaranth entwines. These graces varying with the varying year, Sirisha-blossoms deck the tender ear ; Or new Kadambas, with thy coming born, The parted locks and polislied front adorn. Thus graced, they woo the Yakshas to their arms, And gems, and wine, and music, aid their charms. The strains divine with art celestial thrill, And wines from grapes of heavenly growth distil. The gems bestrew each terrace of delight, Like stars that glitter through the shades of night.
