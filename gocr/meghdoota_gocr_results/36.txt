Shake through each leaf, as birds profanely wrest The reverend boughs to form the rising nest. Where royal Vidiśa confers renown Thy warmest wish shall fruit delightful crown: There, Vetravati's stream ambrosial laves A gentle bank, with mildly murmuring waves ; And there, her rippling brow and polished face Invite thy smiles, and sue for thy embrace. Next, o'er the lesser hills thy flight suspend, And growth erect to drooping flowerets lend;

ANNOTATIONS. Verse 16l. Where royal Vidisa confers renown.] Vidisa is described as the capital of the district of Dasárna. It appears to be the modern Bhilsah, in the province of Malwa. It is still a place of some note; and is well known in India for the superior quality of the tobacco raised in its vicinity.
Verse 163. The Vetravati is the modern Betwah. It rises on the north side of the Vindhya chain; and, pursuing a north-easterly course of 340 miles, traverses the province of Malwa and the south-west corner of Allahabad, and falls into the Jumna below Kalpee. In the early part of its course, it passes through Bhilsa or Vidića.
