अन्तस्तोयं मणिमयभुवस्तुङ्गम_लिहायाः प्रासादास्त्वां तुलयितुमलं यत्र तैस्तैर्विशेषैः ॥ ६६ ॥ हस्ते लीलाकमलमलकं बालकुन्दानुविद्धं नीता लोध्रप्रसवरजसा पाण्डुतामाननश्रीः ॥

Whose beauteous inmates bright as lightning glare, And tabors mock the thunders of the air ; The rainbow flickering gleams along the walls, And glittering rain in sparkling diamonds falls. There lovely triflers wanton through the day, Dress all their care, and all their labour play; One while, the fluttering Lotus fans the fair, Or Kunda top-knots crown the jetty hair.

ANNOTATIONS. Verse 449. I have availed myself of the aid of the Commentators to make out this passage rather more fully than it occurs in the original, and consequently more intelligibly to the English reader. The poet describes the toilet of the Yakshinís, or female Yakshas, through the six seasons of the year, by mentioning as the selected flowers, those peculiar to each period. Thus the Lotus blooms in Sarat or the sultry season, two months of our autumn; the Kunda (Jasminum pubescens) in sisira or the dewy season ; the Lodh, a species of tree (Symplocos racemosa, Rox.), is in blossom in Hemanta or winter; the Kuruvaka (Gomphræna globosa) in Vasanta or spring; the Sirisha (Mimosa Sirisha) in the hot months, or Gríshma; and the Nípa or Kadamba (Nauclea Kadamba) at the setting in of the rains. It is to the Commentators also that I am indebted for the sole occupation of the goddesses being pleasure and dress. The fact is,
- To sing, to dance, To dress, and troll the tongue, and roll the eye, constitutes a very well-educated female, according to the customs of Hindustan. We cannot help, however, being pleased with the simplicity and propriety of taste which gives to the graceful ornaments of nature so prominent a part in the decoration of feminine beauty.
