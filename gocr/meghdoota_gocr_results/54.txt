To snatch the Lord of Swarga from despair, And timely save the trembling hosts of air. Next bid thy thunders o'er the mountain float, And echoing caves repeat the pealing note ; Fit music for the bird, whose lucid eye Gleams like the horned beauty of the sky; Whose moulting plumes, to love maternal dear, Lend brilliant pendants to Bhaváni's ear.

ANNOTATIONS. deity, Skanda, was for the purpose of destroying Táraka, an Asur or demon, who, by the performance of continued and severe austerities, had acquired powers formidable to the gods. The eccentric genius of Southey has rendered it unnecessary, by his poem, "The Curse of Keháma,' for me to explain the nature or results of these acts of devotion. The germ of Skanda was cast by Śiva into the flame of Agni, the god of fire; who, being unable to sustain the increasing burden, transferred it to the goddess Ganga: she accordingly was delivered of the deity, Skanda ; who was afterwards received and reared, among thickets of the Sara reed (Saccharum Sara), by the six daughters of a king, named Krittikā; or, according to other legends, by the wives of seven great Rishis or Saints. In either case, they form in astronomy the asterism of the Pleiades. Upon his coming to maturity, Skanda encountered and killed the demon, who had filled the region of Indra with dismay:
Emissumque imâ de sede Typhoëa terrâ, Celitibus, fecisse metum.
