The Lord of Love, remembering former woe, Wields not in Alaká his bee-strung bow, Yet still he triumphs: for each maid supplies The fatal bow with love-inspiring eyes ; And wanton glances emulate the dart, That speeds unerring to the beating heart. Northward from where Kuvera holds his state, Where Indra's bow surmounts the arching gate;

ANNOTATIONS. Verse 495. The Lord of Love, remembering former woe.] This alludes to the fate which befel the Hindu Cupid upon his assailing Siva, whom, at the desire of the gods, he inflamed with the love of Párvatí. Śiva, in his wrath, reduced the little deity to ashes, by a flame from the eye in his forehead; and, although he was subsequently restored to animation, he is here supposed to remain in dread of his former enemy. The whole story is spiritedly told in Sir William Jones's Hymns to Camdeo and to Durga.
Verse 499. And wanton glances emulate the dart.] The eye-darting arrows is an idea familiar to English poetry; as in these instances : Her eye darted contagious fire.
MILTON. Her eyes carried darts of fire, Feathered all with swift desire.
Greene's “Never too late." I mote perceive how in her glancing sight Legions of loves with little wings did fly, Darting their deadly arrows fiery bright. SPENSER. Sonnet 16. And those love-darting eyes shall roll no more. Pope's Elegy.
