आपृच्छस्व प्रियसखममुं तुङ्गमालिङ्गय शैलं वन्द्यैः पुंसा रघुपतिपदैरङ्कितं मेखलासु ॥ काले काले भवति भवतो यस्य संयोगमेत्य स्नेहव्यक्तिश्चिरविरहजं मुञ्चतो वाष्पमुष्णम् ॥ १२ ॥ मार्ग तावच्छृणु कथयतस्त्वत्प्रयाणानुरूपं सन्देशं मे तदनु जलद श्रोष्यसि श्रोचपेयम् ॥ खिन्नः खिन्नः शिखरिषु पदं न्यस्य गन्तासि यत्र क्षीणः क्षीणः परिलघुपयः स्रोतसां चोपयुज्य ॥ १३॥
Short be thy farewell to this hill addressed; This hill with Rama's holy feet imprest; Thine ancient friend, whose scorching sorrows mourn Thy frequent absence and delayed return. Yet ere thine ear can drink what love inspires, The lengthened way my guiding aid requires. Oft on whose path full many a lofty hill Shall ease thy toils, and many a cooling rill.

Moorcroft's Journey to Mánasarovara : Asiatic Researches, xii. 466. The Rájahansa is described as a kind of goose with white body and red legs and bill; whence Mr. Ellis affirms that it is properly applicable to the Phænicopteros or flamingo.
