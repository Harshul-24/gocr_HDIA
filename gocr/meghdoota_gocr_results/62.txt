Verse 349. She, who with smiling waves disportive strayed.] The earth being unable to bear the sudden descent of so great a river as the Ganges, Śiva was induced, at the intercession of Bhagiratha, to interpose his sacred head. Accordingly, Ganga first alighted on the head of the deity, and remained for a considerable period wandering amongst the tresses of his long and entangled hair, to the extreme jealousy and displeasure, according to Kálidása, of the goddess Gauri or Párvatí, Siva's consort.
Verse 355. Thy form, like Indra's Elephant.] We have already noticed that presiding deities are attached to the various points of the compass, and that each of these deities is furnished with a male and female Elephant. Amongst these, the most distinguished is Airávata, the Elephant of Indra, in his capacity of Regent of the East.
