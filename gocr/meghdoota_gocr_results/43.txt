MEGHA DÚTA, OR
यत्र स्त्रीणां हरति सुरतग्लानिमङ्गानुकूलस्सिप्रावातः प्रियतम इव प्रार्थनाचाटुकारः ॥ ३३ ॥ जालोगीफ्रुपचितवपुः केशसंस्कारधूपैबन्धुप्रीन्या भवनशिखिभिर्दननृत्योपहारः ॥
With friendly zeal they sport around the maid Who early courts their vivifying aid ; And, cool from Sipra's gelid waves, embrace Each languid limb and enervated grace.
212
Here should thy spirit with thy toils decay, Rest from the labours of the wearying way: Round every house the flowery fragrance spreads; O’er every floor the painted footstep treads;

ANNOTATIONS. Verse 211. The Siprá is the river upon the banks of which Oujein stands, and which is called Sipparah in the maps. In Arrowsmith, however, there is another stream with a similar name, the Sipra, which appears to be a continuation of the Sagarmuttee, considerably to the north-east of Oujein. There can be no doubt of the position of the river mentioned by the poet.
Verse 216. The painted footstep.] Staining the soles of the feet with a red colour, derived from the Mehndee, the Lac, &c., is a favourite practice of the Hindu toilet. It is thus elegantly alluded to in the Ode to one of the Female Personifications of Music, the Ráginí Asauveree:
The rose hath humbly bowed to meet, With glowing lips, her hallowed feet,
And lent them all its bloom. Hindu Odes, by John David Paterson, Esq., published in the New Series of Gladwin's Oriental Miscellany, Calcutta.
