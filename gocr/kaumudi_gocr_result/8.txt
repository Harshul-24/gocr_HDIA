An attempt is made to make this small book fully representative of the cultural heritage of ancient India. To keep alive the general interest of the student in the book, variety in selections is maintained throughout by presenting passages of different character, such as narative, epic, dramatic, poetical, historical, religious and the didactic, etc. There is one big vein of high morality that runs throughout the various pieces and links them up in one common whole. This spiritual vein supplies the nation with its life-blood, It nourishes the “constant mind” of Humanity, May the students of Sanskrit who read this book buve a rich supply of this life-blood of the nation. Thus invigorated, they may live a strong and healthy life of disinterested service, in and through the Society, which is the chief message of Sanskrit Literature of a high order, tbrough distant ages.
