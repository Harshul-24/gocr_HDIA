[ The Jataka stoties in Sanskrit are the work of Arya Súrn. They are known as the birth-stories of Buddha in his previous lives known as Bodhi Lattva. The Bodhi Sattva is a name given to one who has a pure intellect free from selfish desires. and who stands ready for final enlightenment or Nirvīru of n Buddha. The Jataka stories are originally pre-Buddhistic and belong to the ancient stock of religious legends of India. The Buddhistic writers gave the stories a Buddhistic touch and a supreme moral tone that is characteristic of Buddhism and is also recognized as the highest achievement of Indian Culture. The students who have read the previous lessons carefully are now well posted to grasp the language of the Jātakas simplified in the following lessons. They will be able to appreciate these nttractive stories which I have taken special pains to 11:2%e encier for them according to the required standard. )
