march from the Artoradeśa and the Pinchtantra. The Jälakres are followed by the verse of Válmíki which is at vnice simple and grand, a must suitable text in verse for a beginner. I take up, next, the stud of the episodes of the Muhábbàrntil, which is so elevating ! As the students learn something of the two great epics of Indi's, they cannot afford to neglect the study of the Purāne literature rich with some of the most valuable national legends of India. I therefore, take up some of the most inspiring legends of the Purân:8, and present time in a manner that should be most pleasing to the students. Next, I turn to the drums of Blása and present them in a sunmıry form, according to our special requirements. These simple dialogues, are bounil to create in the minds of the students, a lively interest which will certainly be of grent help in the growth of their knowledge of Sanskrit lungunge. Having entered at the threshold of the Kavya literature, I proceed to Kalidasa with his tasiest poem the Ritu Samhara, make suitable changes in the text, and offer it for the aesthetic entertainment of our students. I also wish to give the students a foretaste of the classical Sanskrit pro-e. Thus I take the most instructive chapter of Bana's Kādambari made particularly easy, accoriling to our required :standard. I close up the book with the didactic poems of Bhartriburi. The students would be Tell-advised if they learnt by heart a collection of happy verses scattered throughout the book.
