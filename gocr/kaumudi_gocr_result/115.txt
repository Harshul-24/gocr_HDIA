( महाभारते युधिष्ठिर-शक्र-संवादः) ततः शक्रः पार्थम् रथेनोपययो। तं चाब्रवीत् । देवरथमेनमारोह । धर्मराजो युधिष्ठिरस्तु स्वभ्रातृन् पतितान् दृष्ट्वा शोक-संतप्तः शक्रमिदमब्रवीत्भ्रातरः पतिता मेऽत्र, गच्छेयुस्ते मया सह । न विना भ्रातृभिः स्वर्गमीहे गन्तुं सुरेश्वर ॥१॥
सकुमारी सुखाही च, राजपुत्री पुरंदर ! सहास्माभिर्हि सा गच्छेत्, तद्भवाननुमन्यताम् ॥ २॥
